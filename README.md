# QLearningForecast
**This is a package that implements forecasting model dynamic selection via Q-learning.**

As described in:

**Reinforced Deterministic and Probabilistic Load Forecasting via  Q-Learning Dynamic Model Selection**, Cong Feng, Mucun Sun, and Jie Zhang, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 11(2), pp.1377-1386. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8813103]

**Reinforcement learning based dynamic model selection for short-term load forecasting**, Cong Feng and Jie Zhang, 2019 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT) (pp. 1-5). IEEE. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8791671]


## How to use
Ideally, Q-learning could be used to dynamically select forecasting models from any model pool for any forecasting task. In this repo, we demonstrate selecting models from a model pool with 10 machine learning models for 1-hour-ahead electricity load forecasting problem.

### Dataset
The example dataset in this repo contains load forecasts from the 10 machine learning with a length of 5 days. Q-learning agents will learn from previous four days' forecasts and make decisions of selecting models for the last day.

### Environment
```
# Install packages within R
install.packages(c("zoo"))
```

### Execute example code
```
# Specify directories in qlearning_load_forecasting.R in R
root_code <- '~/R'
root_data <- '~/data'
root_save <- '~/results'
# run R script
Rscript qlearning_load_forecasting.R
```
